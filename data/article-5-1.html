			<p>A favourite carol for Midnight Mass begins,</p>
			<p> <i>"It came upon a midnight clear<br />that glorious song of old...<br />The world in solemn stillness lay<br />to hear the angels sing."</i></p>
           
                <p>Quiet, clear air, crispness, stillness, peaceâ€¦are images which console and caress us.</p>
                <p>God's zeal for our welfare (Isa 9:7), the appearance of the grace of God (Titus 2:11)
God's promise of peace (Lk2:14), are assurances of great joy and fullness of life to come.</p>
				<p>However, the readings for this liturgy are disturbing in their content, and it is important that our hunger for certitude and peace does not blind us to the reality that this kingdom of righteousness is a reality in the now only as we cooperate with the power of God's Spirit. (Titus 3:7)</p>
