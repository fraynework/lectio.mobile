			<h1 class="deco">Titus 2:11-14 </h1>
			<p>The letter to Titus looks towards the establishment of the kingdom also, perhaps anticipating its coming sooner than later. But however long we wait, we are to accept the training (knowledge and wisdom) offered to us through the grace of the Spirit. Then comes the disturbing challenge: we are to renounce one way of life and become self-controlled and upright. So, in the still of midnight worship, there are hard demands made on us to respond to Christ who "gave himself for us".</p>
