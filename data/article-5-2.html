			<h1 class="deco">Isaiah 9:2-7</h1>
			<p>Isaiah the prophet, looks with hope to the leadership of a small nation facing military invasion and the tensions of diplomatic and political intrigues. The people walking in the darkness of injustice and oppression will be enlightened and freed by a ruler to come who will establish justice and peace. But the establishment and continuance of the godly kingdom by this king, counselor and father, only grows as much as people respond to his gracious authority. An emphasis in Isaiah is that pride is the great sin: the prophet calls for true enlightenment and knowledge of the Lord through wise judgment and holy justice. These are the virtues that take the people out of darkness, and along the road of light.
